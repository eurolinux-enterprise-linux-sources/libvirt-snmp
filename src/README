	libvirt-snmp: SNMP API for libvirt

   Libvirt-snmp provides SNMP functionality for libvirt. Therefore
it is now possible to gather and set domain status over SNMP from
one place. This allows to create views of entire platforms end to
end.

This code is distributed under GPLv2, or (at your option) any later
version.
